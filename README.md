# Brief Introduction
Implemented a collaborative music playing application using Python, Javascript, React and Django.  
Developed the frontend using Webpack and Babel to bundle the React application to integrate with Django.  
Implented page design and redirections with React Router and Material UI, and integrated the Spotify API to control usersâ€™ playback.  
Implemented a real-time player using React Lifecycle Methods, to solve the problem that Spotify does not support Websocket.  
Implemented a backend Django REST API using the Django Rest Framework and Mongo DB. Also deployed Django on Nginx with uWSGI.
